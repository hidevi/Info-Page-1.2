          We are Conextus Incorporated which is a startup founded in July 2015. In Conextus Inc., we specialize in developing smartphone applications specialized as a means for solving major pains and problems prevalent in the lives of our customers. To this end, our debut product Conextus is a smartphone application intended to serve as a means to assist college and university students to discover, network, and plan face-to-face social interactions with students sharing common interests.

        <h4 class="section-title">Application</h4>
        <p>
          Our debut product, Conextus, has a competitive edge over competitors, like Tinder or WeChat for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike Tinder, Conextus is specifically designed for non-romantic friendships and will be marketed as such. Instead of helping users find a significant other, Conextus  being designed for College undergraduate students in need of a better social life will link users up with multiple fellow students with whom users share common interests. Conextus  also has a menu where users can select activities to do with their potential new friends which are non romantic and suitable for groups of friends. Conextus 's primary means of alleviating loneliness is providing users the means to find compatibility in a group-oriented setting, getting students out of isolation as well as bridging the social and cultural gaps and on campuses. Moreover, unlike WeChat, Conextus  on a specific location, college campuses instead of a wider area like a city meaning users know the area and are familiar with it making them more inclined to find friends and people with similar interests with more predictability for interaction. In Conextus Inc., we believe that the best way to build big is to start small and in a specific fixed location which is applicable to social life. Since Conextus  is focused on a specific area in particular a college or university campus, this means there is a security layer added, a feature absent in more wider oriented apps like WeChat which is users' SFU email ID and its subsequent verification by users through a confirmation message sent to users' emails.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          At the same time, our competitors in the vein of Tinder and Friendsy are already well established, popular and adapting all the time meaning, they will keep expanding, finding more users and developing new features that have the potential to be appealing to all walks of life thus rivaling or mimicking the features and purpose of our product. Our competitors may react of our product's introduction by expanding physically to Canada and North America to be visible in person and well-established gaining a competitive edge over Conextus Inc., and Project Conextus or adopting similar features as Conextus , which can beat us to popularity given the popularity, constantly changing and well-established nature of competing products like Tinder. Another way competitors can react to our product's introduction is offer to buy our product Conextus  or even acquire our company Conextus Inc., by paying us a huge amount of money in return. At Conextus Inc., we strive to overcome (non) adoption of our company or production Conextus  by providing our customers with a product that possesses features that differ from our competitions and correct common problems found in competing products. These range all the way from a catchy logo design, better security such as proper email verification and scrambled texts for users to enter, a step to ensure that our app has human users only with no bots, this latter point a flaw found in our competitors like Tinder. Lastly, our company will be sensitive and open to our customers' suggestions, complaints, and desires, to this end continuously adapting our product to better serve our customers while providing quality customer service such as but not limited to Questions and Answers, customer outreach events and a physical building for our business so to be recognizable and connect with customers.
